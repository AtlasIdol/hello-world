My name is Timothy and I am currently enrolled in the Software Development program at Ivy Tech Evansville
I have been studying Python for a few months now and I feel that I am on the cusp of being an *intermediate programmer*
I have researched and attempted several projects including a **random number generator** and a **login system** connected to a database
